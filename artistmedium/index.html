            While I primarily work with oil paints, I also enjoy experimenting
            with watercolors and acrylics. Each medium offers unique challenges
            and opportunities for self-expression.

            Acrylic Paint: Acrylics are versatile and fast-drying. They can be
            used for a wide range of techniques, from thin washes to thick
            impasto.
          </p>
          <p class="while-i-primarily">
            Oil paints are known for their richness and blending capabilities.
            They have a slower drying time, which allows for more intricate work
            and layering.
          </p>
          <p class="while-i-primarily">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="while-i-primarily">
            Watercolors are transparent paints that are often used for delicate
            and expressive works. They are known for their luminosity and are
            applied with water.
          </p>
          <p class="while-i-primarily">
            Gouache is similar to watercolor but more opaque. It's popular for
            its ability to be layered and reworked. Pastels come in various
            forms, including soft pastels, oil pastels, and hard pastels. They
            offer vibrant color and are applied directly onto the surface.

          <p class="while-i-primarily">
            Ink can be used for both drawing and painting. It can create bold,
            flowing lines or delicate, detailed work. Artists often combine
            multiple mediums in a single artwork, creating unique textures and
            visual effects.

            Digital Painting: With the advent of digital technology, artists can
            create paintings using software and graphic tablets, allowing for
            endless possibilities and easy editing.
